# Movie Hybrid Recommendation System - Data Science & Modeling Plan

## 1. Data Collection & Understanding
- **Dataset Familiarization:**  
  - Review all MovieLens files: movies, ratings, tags, and links.  
  - Understand the schema and relationships (e.g., movie metadata, user ratings, and user-generated tags).  

- **Documentation Review:**  
  - Read any accompanying documentation to grasp data limitations and context.  

## 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Descriptive Statistics:**  
  - Summarize basic statistics (means, medians, distributions) for ratings, movie counts, and tag usage.  

- **Data Visualization:**  
  - Plot histograms and box plots for rating distributions.  
  - Visualize genre distribution and frequency of tags.  
  - Explore user behavior (e.g., number of ratings per user) and movie popularity metrics.  

- **Identify Data Quality Issues:**  
  - Check for missing values, duplicates, or anomalies.  
  - Explore correlations between variables (e.g., ratings vs. number of ratings).  

## 3. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- **Cleaning:**  
  - Remove duplicates and handle missing or inconsistent entries.  
  - Standardize text fields (e.g., genre names, tag text).  

- **Data Integration:**  
  - Merge datasets (e.g., join movies with their average ratings and aggregated tags).  
  - Create a unified dataset that combines content (genres, tags) and collaborative (user ratings) information.  

- **Normalization & Transformation:**  
  - Normalize numerical features if needed.  
  - Convert categorical fields to appropriate formats (e.g., one-hot encoding or label encoding for genres).  

## 4. Feature Engineering
- **Content-Based Features:**  
  - Process text features (genres, tags) using techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings.  
  - Create composite text features by combining genres and tags for each movie.  

- **Collaborative Features:**  
  - Construct a user-item rating matrix.  
  - Derive additional features such as average rating per movie, rating variance, or popularity metrics.  

- **Additional Feature Creation:**  
  - Engineer features like release year, runtime, or other metadata if available.  
  - Experiment with dimensionality reduction (e.g., PCA) on high-dimensional text features.  

## 5. Modeling Approaches
- **Content-Based Filtering:**  
  - Use similarity measures (e.g., cosine similarity on TF-IDF vectors) to recommend movies based on content.  

- **Collaborative Filtering:**  
  - Implement models such as user-based or item-based filtering.  
  - Explore matrix factorization techniques (e.g., SVD) to capture latent factors.  

- **Hybrid Model Strategy:**  
  - Combine outputs from both content-based and collaborative models.  
  - Consider strategies like weighted averaging of scores, stacking, or meta-learning to integrate both recommendations.  

## 6. Model Training & Evaluation
- **Train-Test Split / Cross-Validation:**  
  - Split your data to create training and validation sets or use cross-validation to assess model performance.  

- **Hyperparameter Tuning:**  
  - Experiment with different hyperparameters (e.g., number of neighbors in k-NN, regularization parameters for matrix factorization).  

- **Evaluation Metrics:**  
  - Use metrics like RMSE, MAE for rating prediction, and precision/recall, MAP, or NDCG for ranking and recommendation quality.  
  - Perform error analysis to understand mis-recommendations.  

- **Iterative Refinement:**  
  - Refine your feature engineering and model parameters based on validation results.  

## 7. Final Model Selection & Interpretability
- **Select Best Models:**  
  - Choose the top-performing content-based and collaborative models.  
  - Develop the final hybrid model by integrating the strengths of both approaches.  

- **Interpretability:**  
  - Analyze feature importances or latent factors to understand what drives the recommendations.  
  - Document insights from model behavior and performance.  

## 8. Documentation & Reporting
- **Project Report:**  
  - Summarize your EDA findings, data cleaning steps, and feature engineering process.  
  - Compare different modeling approaches and their evaluation metrics.  
  - Document assumptions, challenges, and potential future improvements.  

- **Visualization & Presentation:**  
  - Prepare clear visualizations and dashboards that highlight key insights and model performance.  
  - Write a comprehensive report that explains your methodology and conclusions.
