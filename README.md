# ðŸš€ Movie Recommendation System

A FastAPI-powered movie recommendation system that uses KNN and content-based filtering to suggest movies. It leverages TF-IDF, Word2Vec, and multiple features like genre similarity, tags, Bayesian average rating, rating recency, popularity, and release year for precise recommendations. Built with Python, FastAPI, Scikit-learn, Pandas, and Uvicorn.
